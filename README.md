# Second Serving - Hackathon 2025 Project
- 1st Place winner at AurariaHack 2025 hosted by the AI Student Association (AISA).
- Built to reduce food waste & tackle food insecurity in Colorado.

## Overview
**Second Serving** is an AI enhanced full-stack application that connects families and restaurants with surplus food to shelters and families in need. Inspired by the food deserts of Colorado, particuarly the community of Green Valley Ranch, this platform has:
- Donors (families, individuals, restaurants) post about their food surplus.
- Shelters and recipients may claim said food or create wishlists of food they would like.
- AI assisted search, food tagging for allergies or preferences (no pork, no cow, etc), and chatbot guidance.
- Drop off map of nearby shelters, soon to incorporate family delivery address.

## Social Impact & ROI

Food waste and food insecurity go hand in hand - the US discards about 120 billion pounds (40%) of the entire US food supply. These are good meals that are being thrown out daily while many families and individuals will go hungry.

Second Serving tackles this problem by:
- Diverting surplus food from restaurants & families to communities in need, in return can get a tax write off for charity.
- Reducing C02 emissions from food waste.
- Making donation and claiming process AI-assisted for those who have difficulty navigating the platform.
